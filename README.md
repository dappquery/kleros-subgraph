This PoC aims to demonstrate how easily [Kleros](https://kleros.io) dispute data can be indexed and queried using GraphQL. The subgraph includes indexed dispute data from the smart
contract deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. Among the main features that can be exploited through the graph we have:

* **Up-to-date Kleros dashboard**: Dashboard data is indexed as soon as transaction is mined.
* **Aggregated statistics for Analysis**: Our subgraph aggregates userâ€™s contributions in real-time and displays on dashboard:
  Below statistics are displayed on dashboard:
    * Total disputes created
    * Total active courts
    * Total Jurors who staked
    * Total amount staked
    * Total earnings in PNK token as well as ETH
